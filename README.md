# Simple Call Counter.

Counts each call you receive with clicking a button.
Save the amount of calls for each day in a .txt with date and time.
Now it wont allow you to save the file unless a call was made. Button will be grayed out.




TODO:

1.	Calendar Chooser - needs to show how many calls were received for the selected date.
2.	Maybe calculate how many calls were done at the end of each month.
3.	Implement a timer, so you can track how long was each call.
