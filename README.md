# CallCounter
Simple Call Counter.
Counts each call you receive with clicking a button.
Save the amount of calls for each day in a .txt with date and time.

TODO:
Calendar Chooser - needs to show how many calls were received for the selected date.

Maybe calculate how many calls were done at the end of each month.
